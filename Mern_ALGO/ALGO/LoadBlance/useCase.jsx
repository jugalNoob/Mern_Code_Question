1. Static Algorithms
Use Cases:
Predictable traffic patterns: Applications with consistent traffic and no dynamic changes, such as internal tools or APIs.
Failover systems: Predefined routes to a secondary server when a primary server is unavailable.
Single-tenant systems: Assigning specific clients to dedicated servers for isolation and compliance.
2. Round Robin Algorithms
Use Cases:
Simple load balancing: Distributes traffic equally across servers in environments where all servers have equal capacity.
Clustered systems: Distributes work among compute nodes in data processing pipelines.
Database query routing: Routes queries evenly among database replicas for read-heavy workloads.
3. Weighted Round Robin Algorithms
Use Cases:
Unequal server capacities: When some servers are more powerful and can handle higher traffic.
Geographically distributed servers: Assigning more traffic to nearby or higher-capacity data centers.
Cloud and on-premises hybrid setups: Giving more weight to on-premises servers for cost efficiency while using cloud servers as overflow.
4. Dense Round Robin Algorithms
Use Cases:
Dynamic server pools: Handles changing server availability in cloud environments.
Graceful degradation: Automatically skips failed or overloaded servers.
Cost optimization: Dynamically removes underutilized servers from rotation during low traffic periods.
5. IP Hash Algorithms
Use Cases:
Session stickiness: Ensures a user stays connected to the same server for stateful interactions (e.g., gaming sessions, shopping carts).
Geo-targeting: Directs traffic from certain IP ranges to specific regional servers for latency reduction.
Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) protection: Identifies malicious IP ranges and blocks them.
6. URL Hash Algorithms
Use Cases:
Content-specific routing: Routes traffic for specific URLs to optimized servers (e.g., /images to CDN servers).
API segregation: Assigns API endpoints to different server groups (e.g., /auth to authentication servers, /data to database query servers).
Caching optimization: Ensures the same URL consistently reaches the same cache server for efficiency.
7. Random Allocation
Use Cases:
Simplified load distribution: Useful in environments where all servers are identical, and traffic patterns are unpredictable.
Testing environments: Randomly assigns traffic to test different servers or configurations.
Disaster recovery drills: Randomly routes traffic to secondary servers to simulate outages.
8. Dynamic Algorithms
Use Cases:
Real-time load adjustments: Routes traffic based on server CPU, memory, or response time.
Auto-scaling systems: Dynamically adjusts traffic as servers are added or removed from the pool.
Cloud-native applications: Optimized for environments where server capacity can fluctuate rapidly.
9. Least Connection
Use Cases:
Connection-intensive applications: Ideal for chat apps, video conferencing, or file transfer systems where some requests last longer than others.
Load-sensitive environments: Prevents uneven load distribution during traffic spikes.
Database load balancing: Routes queries to the least busy database replica.
10. Weighted Least Connection Algorithms
Use Cases:
Mixed server capacities: Directs fewer connections to less powerful servers and more to robust ones.
Service quality optimization: Ensures fast response times even during peak loads.
Edge computing: Balances requests between edge nodes with different capabilities.
11. Least Response Time Algorithms
Use Cases:
User experience optimization: Routes requests to servers with the quickest response times, reducing perceived latency.
Hybrid cloud environments: Ensures requests are sent to the most responsive server, whether on-premises or in the cloud.
API services: Balances API traffic to improve SLA adherence.
12. Resource-Based Algorithms
Use Cases:
High-performance computing: Balances computational tasks based on CPU and memory usage.
IoT device traffic: Routes data from devices to servers optimized for specific tasks (e.g., real-time processing vs. batch processing).
Video streaming platforms: Dynamically routes traffic based on server bandwidth and processing capabilities.
13. Geo-Location Based Load Balancing
Use Cases:
Latency reduction: Routes users to the nearest data center for faster responses.
Regulatory compliance: Ensures traffic complies with data residency laws (e.g., GDPR).
Regional traffic spikes: Handles sudden traffic increases in specific regions (e.g., during a local event).
14. Rate Limiting
Use Cases:
API protection: Prevents abuse by limiting the number of requests from individual clients.
DDoS mitigation: Blocks excessive traffic from specific IP addresses or regions.
Fair usage enforcement: Ensures equitable resource usage across multiple clients.
15. Session Persistence
Use Cases:
Stateful applications: Ensures users remain connected to the same server for applications like online gaming or shopping carts.
WebSocket-based systems: Maintains a consistent connection for real-time interactions.
E-commerce platforms: Prevents session data inconsistencies for logged-in users.
