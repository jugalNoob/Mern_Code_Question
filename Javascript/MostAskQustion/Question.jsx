üîπ 1. var, let, const ‚Äì Difference?

Answer:

var: Function-scoped, hoisted, can be redeclared.

let: Block-scoped, hoisted (in temporal dead zone), can be reassigned but not redeclared.

const: Block-scoped, cannot be reassigned, must be initialized.

function test() {
  var x = 1;
  let y = 2;
  const z = 3;
  if (true) {
    var x = 10; // redeclared
    let y = 20; // block scope
    // z = 30; ‚ùå Error
  }
  console.log(x); // 10
  console.log(y); // 2
}
test();
