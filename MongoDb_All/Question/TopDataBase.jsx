Weaviate: Another vector database optimized for storing and querying large-scale vector data.


6::--Key-Value Database:  ---------------------------
Simple database that stores data as a collection of key-value pairs.
Offers fast read/write operations and is often used for caching, session management.
Examples: Redis, DynamoDB, Riak.

Redis: An in-memory data structure store, commonly used as a cache, message broker, or database.
Amazon DynamoDB: A fully managed key-value and document database service known for its high availability.
Riak: A distributed NoSQL key-value database designed for high availability and fault tolerance.


7::Time-Series Database:  ---------------------------------
Specializes in handling time-stamped or time-series data.
Optimized for performance on queries over time intervals, making it ideal for monitoring, IoT, financial data.
Examples: InfluxDB, TimescaleDB, OpenTSDB.

InfluxDB: One of the most popular time-series databases, optimized for handling high-write and query loads.
TimescaleDB: An extension for PostgreSQL, designed to make SQL scalable for time-series data.
Prometheus: An open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit, which includes a time-series database.



Q what is Json vs Bson vs Gson ?

Summary:

JSON is a text-based data format for data interchange.

BSON is a binary format derived from JSON, optimized for storage and speed, mainly used in databases like MongoDB.

GSON is a Java library for serializing and deserializing Java objects to and from JSON.

JSON, BSON, and GSON serve different purposes in the data serialization world, with JSON being text-based, 
BSON being a binary format optimized for databases, and GSON being a library for Java.

YAML and XML are also popular text-based formats, often used for configuration files and data exchange.

Protobuf and Avro are binary formats designed for efficiency in both storage and processing, often used in systems
where performance is critical.



 JSON (JavaScript Object Notation): :::::::: -----------------

What is it?

JSON is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for
machines to parse and generate. It's based on a subset of JavaScript but is language-independent.

Structure:
JSON uses a text-based structure composed of key-value pairs (objects) or ordered lists of values (arrays).

Usage:
Widely used for data exchange between a server and a client, especially in web applications. It's 
also commonly used in configuration files.

{
  "name": "John",
  "age": 30,
  "isStudent": false,
  "skills": ["Java", "Python"]
}

BSON (Binary JSON): ::::::::::::::::::: ------------------->>

What is it?
BSON is a binary representation of JSON-like documents. It's used primarily in MongoDB as the format for storing documents.

Structure:
Unlike JSON, which is text-based, BSON is a binary format, which makes it more efficient 
in terms of storage space and speed when processing.
BSON includes additional data types not present in JSON, such as Date, ObjectId, and binary data.

Usage:
Primarily used in databases like MongoDB to store data efficiently and quickly serialize/deserialize data.

Example:
A JSON document like:

{ "name": "John", "age": 30 }


. GSON (Google JSON):::::::::::: ------------------------->>

What is it?
GSON is a Java library developed by Google that provides methods to convert Java objects to JSON (serialization) 
and JSON to Java objects (deserialization).

Structure:
GSON handles JSON data in its native format and can parse/produce JSON strings that represent Java objects.
It also provides features for handling more complex JSON structures, such as nested objects or arrays.

Usage:
Used in Java applications where there is a need to convert Java objects to JSON for transmission over a network
or to store JSON data in a format that Java can easily interpret.

code :: --->
Gson gson = new Gson();
String json = gson.toJson(new User("John", 30)); // Java object to JSON
User user = gson.fromJson(json, User.class); // JSON to Java object





Q what is different between Json.parse()  and Json.stringify methods in javascript?






Q MongoDB is a NoSQL database, which is categorized under the following types:

...::Document-Oriented Database: MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, which means that fields can vary
from document to document and data structure can change over time.

...::Key-Value Store: While MongoDB is primarily document-oriented, it can also function as a key-value store, where each 
document is identified by a unique key (usually the _id field).

...::Distributed Database: MongoDB is designed for distributed environments, allowing data to be distributed across
multiple servers. It supports features like sharding, which helps to scale horizontally by distributing data across clusters.

..::Schema-Free Database: Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB does not require a predefined schema.
This allows for greater flexibility in data storage, as the structure of documents can evolve over time without needing to update a schema.

...::Horizontally Scalable Database: MongoDB supports horizontal scaling, which means it can handle a large 
amount of data by adding more servers to distribute the load.

...::These characteristics make MongoDB suitable for applications that require high scalability,
flexibility in data structure, and the ability to handle large volumes of data across distributed systems.
