Q what is Url , Uri , Urn ?


URL, URI, and URN are terms related to resource identification on the web. While they may sound similar, they serve different purposes. Let’s break them down:

1. URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)  :::::::::::::
Definition: A URI is a generic term that refers to any string of characters used to identify a resource, whether it be on the web or elsewhere. A URI can identify a resource either by location, name, or both.
Components: A URI can be a URL, URN, or both, depending on how the resource is identified.
scheme:[//authority]path[?query][#fragment]
Example of a URI:
bash
Copy code
https://example.com/resource?id=123#section2


In this case, the scheme is https, the path is /resource, and there’s a query parameter id=123 and a fragment #section2. This is both a URL and a URI because it identifies the resource by location (it's reachable via HTTP).


2. URL (Uniform Resource Locator) ::::::::::::::
Definition: A URL is a specific type of URI that provides the location of a resource. In other words, it tells you where a resource is located and how to access it, usually via protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, etc.
Components: A URL usually contains:
Scheme: Protocol used (e.g., http, https, ftp).
Host/Authority: Domain name or IP address.
Path: The specific resource within the host.
Port (optional): The port number (e.g., :80, :443).
Query (optional): Query parameters (e.g., ?id=123).
Fragment (optional): A section of the resource (e.g., #section2).
Example of a URL:
arduino
Copy code
https://www.example.com/index.html?user=john
This URL specifies the protocol (https), the host (www.example.com), the path (/index.html), and includes a query (?user=john).
A URL locates a resource by providing the means to retrieve it (typically over a network).


3. URN (Uniform Resource Name) :::::::::::::::::
Definition: A URN is another type of URI that names a resource without specifying its location or how to retrieve it. It identifies a resource by name in a persistent way, regardless of its location.
Components: A URN has the following format:
urn:<namespace>:<resource-name>
Example of a URN:
css
Copy code
urn:isbn:0451450523
In this example, the URN uses the namespace isbn (International Standard Book Number) to uniquely identify a specific book, but it does not provide the location of the book.



Key Differences:
Term	Stands for	Purpose	Example
URI	Uniform Resource Identifier :: 	Generic term for identifying a resource	:: https://example.com/resource?id=123
URL	Uniform Resource Locator	:: Identifies a resource by its location ::	https://example.com/index.html
URN	Uniform Resource Name	:: Identifies a resource by name (not location)	:: urn:isbn:0451450523

Q what are Http Headers ?

Ans: Metadata  --> Key -value sent along with request & response

--->Caching , authentication , managa state
x-prefix->2012 (x-deprecated)


.Request Header   --> from client 
.Respones header  --> from server 
.Representation Header --> encoding / Compression 
.Payload header  --> data 



Q what is Http methods ?  :::::: ..............

Basic set Of Operations that can be used To Interact 
with server 


..Get  -- > retrieve a resource 

..Head  --? No message body (response headers only)

..Options --> what Operations are available  

..Trace -->LoopBack test (get same data)

..Delete  --> remove a resourse 

..Put  --> resplace a resourse

..Post --> interact with resource (Mostly add)

..Patch  --> change part of a resourse


Q what is Status Code ?

.. 1xx Infromation 

.. 2xx Success 

..3xx Redirection 

.. 4xx Client error 

.. 5xx Server error
