Q Types of Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or system before granting access to resources.

1::. Password-Based Authentication
Description: Users provide a password to verify their identity.
Examples:
Traditional login systems (username and password).
PIN codes.


2::. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Description: Requires two or more authentication factors from different categories.
Examples:
Combining a password with a one-time code sent to a mobile device.
Using a fingerprint scan along with a password.


3::Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
Description: A subset of MFA that specifically requires two different factors.
Examples:
Password and SMS code.
Password and authenticator app code.


4::Biometric Authentication
Description: Uses unique biological characteristics to verify identity.
Examples:
Fingerprint recognition.
Facial recognition.
Iris scanning.
Voice recognition.


5::Token-Based Authentication
Description: Uses a token (physical or digital) to authenticate.
Examples:
Hardware tokens (e.g., RSA SecureID).
Software tokens (e.g., Google Authenticator).
JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for web authentication.


6::ertificate-Based Authentication
Description: Uses digital certificates to verify identity.
Examples:
SSL/TLS certificates for website security.
Client certificates for accessing corporate resources.


7:::Single Sign-On (SSO)
Description: Allows users to log in once and gain access to multiple systems.
Examples:
OAuth (used by Google, Facebook for third-party logins).
SAML (used by enterprises for federated identity).


8:: OAuth and OpenID Connect
Description: OAuth is a protocol for authorization; OpenID Connect is an authentication layer on top of OAuth.
Examples:
Logging into third-party applications using Google or Facebook accounts.
API access with OAuth tokens.

9::Knowledge-Based Authentication (KBA)
Description: Verifies identity by asking questions based on pre-shared or dynamically generated information.
Examples:
Security questions.
Questions based on credit report information.


10::Contextual or Adaptive Authentication
Description: Adjusts the authentication requirements based on the context of the login attempt.
Examples:
Stricter authentication for login attempts from unusual locations.
Different requirements based on the time of day or device used.


11::Smart Card Authentication
Description: Uses a smart card embedded with a microchip to authenticate.
Examples:
Employee ID cards.
Government-issued identity cards.


12::Mobile-Based Authentication
Description: Uses a mobile device for authentication.
Examples:
SMS-based verification codes.
Mobile apps generating OTPs (One-Time Passwords).


13::Behavioral Biometrics
Description: Analyzes behavioral patterns to verify identity.
Examples:
Typing patterns.
Mouse movement patterns.




000::::Authorization is the process of determining what a user or system can do after their identity has
been authenticated. Here are the main types of authorization:

1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Description: Access is granted based on the user's role within an organization.
Examples:
An employee in the "Manager" role can access management reports, while an employee in the "Staff" role cannot.
Users assigned to the "Admin" role can manage system settings, while "User" roles can only use the application.

2. Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
Description: Access decisions are based on attributes (e.g., user attributes, resource attributes, environment conditions).
Examples:
Access to sensitive data is granted if the user's department is "Finance" and the time is within business hours.
A user with the attribute "Project Leader" can modify project files, while others can only view them.

3. Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC)
Description: Access is governed by policies that define conditions under which access is granted or denied.
Examples:
Policies that allow access to a resource only if the user's security clearance is above a certain level.
Policies that deny access to external users during system maintenance periods.

4. Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
Description: The owner of a resource controls who can access it.
Examples:
File sharing where the file owner can set permissions for who can read, write, or execute the file.
Database management systems where users can grant access to their own data tables.

5. Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
Description: Access is based on fixed policies established by a central authority, not the resource owner.
Examples:
Military systems where access is based on security clearances and the classification of the information.
Access to certain systems is determined by policies that cannot be altered by end-users.

6. Rule-Based Access Control
Description: Access is granted or denied based on a set of rules defined by the system administrator.
Examples:
Firewall rules that allow or deny traffic based on IP addresses and port numbers.
Network access control rules that grant access based on device type and compliance with security policies.

7. Contextual or Risk-Based Access Control
Description: Access decisions are based on the context or perceived risk of the access request.
Examples:
Access is allowed if the user is on a known network and using a trusted device.
Additional verification is required if the login attempt is from a new location or unusual time.

8. Identity-Based Access Control (IBAC)
Description: Access is based on the specific identity of the user rather than their role or attributes.
Examples:
Specific user accounts are granted access to sensitive areas of a system.
Individual users are given personalized access permissions based on their unique identity.

9. Time-Based Access Control
Description: Access is granted or denied based on time constraints.
Examples:
Employees can access the office building only during business hours.
Access to a database is allowed only during a specific maintenance window.

10. Location-Based Access Control
Description: Access is determined by the geographic location of the user or device.
Examples:
Access to corporate resources is restricted to users within the company’s country.
Sensitive data access is only allowed from on-premises networks.

11. Resource-Based Access Control
Description: Access is determined by the resource itself, often through tags or labels.
Examples:
Documents tagged as "Confidential" can only be accessed by users with the "Confidential" clearance.
Cloud storage buckets with specific labels that define access policies.

12. Break-Glass Access Control
Description: Temporary, emergency access is granted to users in critical situations.
Examples:
Emergency access to a patient’s medical records during a critical health event.
Temporary elevated privileges granted to a system administrator to fix an urgent issue.
