Here are some of the most important topics in Redis, covering various aspects from basics to advanced features, performance tuning, and high-availability setups.

1. Data Types
Strings: The simplest data type, often used for caching, counters, and session tokens.
Lists: Ordered sequences of strings, suitable for message queues or streams.
Sets: Unordered collections of unique strings, useful for membership checks and uniqueness.
Sorted Sets: Sets ordered by a score, useful for ranking systems like leaderboards.
Hashes: Maps between string fields and values, often used for storing objects or user profiles.
Bitmaps and HyperLogLogs: Specialized types for bit-level operations and approximate counting.
Streams: For handling event streams and real-time data.
2. Persistence
RDB Snapshots: Creates point-in-time snapshots of the dataset, useful for backups.
AOF (Append-Only File): Logs each write operation, providing more durability than snapshots.
Hybrid Approach: Combining RDB and AOF to balance performance and persistence.
AOF Rewrite: Compacts the AOF file to reduce disk space and startup time.
3. Transactions and Atomicity
Transactions: Executed using MULTI and EXEC, allowing batch operations.
Atomic Commands: Commands like INCR and DECR are atomic, ensuring safe counter increments in a distributed setting.
Optimistic Locking with WATCH: For conditional updates, using WATCH and EXEC to prevent data inconsistency in multi-client environments.
4. Pub/Sub Messaging
Publish/Subscribe Model: Supports real-time messaging, useful for notifications, live updates, and event-driven architectures.
Channels and Patterns: Messages can be sent to channels directly or to a set of channels matching a pattern.
5. Caching Strategies
Cache-aside: Data is only cached when requested and populated in Redis.
Write-through: Data is written to Redis and the database at the same time.
Write-behind: Data is first written to Redis, and later asynchronously saved to the database.
Expiration Policies: Setting TTLs on keys to control cache lifetime.
Eviction Policies: When memory is full, Redis can evict data based on policies like LRU (Least Recently Used), LFU (Least Frequently Used), etc.
6. High Availability and Scalability
Replication: Redis can replicate data to multiple replicas, useful for read scaling and failover.
Redis Sentinel: Provides high availability and monitoring for Redis clusters, handling automatic failover.
Redis Cluster: Allows for data partitioning across multiple Redis instances, enabling horizontal scaling.
7. Performance Optimization
Connection Pooling: Reduces the overhead of creating connections by reusing them.
Pipeline and Batch Operations: Sends multiple commands in a single request to reduce latency.
Lazy Loading and Eager Loading: Optimizes data retrieval strategies to reduce redundant fetches.
Memory Optimization: Efficient use of data types, like using BITFIELDS for compact storage of numbers or Sets for deduplication.
8. Security
Authentication: Password protection for Redis using requirepass.
Access Control Lists (ACLs): Role-based access control to limit command access for users.
SSL/TLS Encryption: Protects data in transit, especially for cloud-based Redis.
Network Isolation: Using Redis within a virtual private network or behind a firewall for added security.
9. Monitoring and Metrics
Redis CLI: Basic monitoring using commands like INFO and MONITOR.
Keyspace Notifications: Monitors events related to keys (e.g., expiry or eviction).
Redis Exporter: Exports Redis metrics for monitoring platforms like Prometheus.
Latency Analysis: Identifies command latencies and performance bottlenecks.
10. Modules and Extensions
RedisJSON: Allows storing, querying, and manipulating JSON documents.
RediSearch: Full-text search capabilities in Redis, including indexing and querying.
RedisGraph: Graph database module for complex relationships and graph traversal.
RedisBloom: Implements probabilistic data structures like Bloom Filters and Count-Min Sketch.
11. Data Consistency and Integrity
Data Expiration and Eviction Policies: Understanding EXPIRE, TTL, and eviction policies to control data lifecycle.
Handling Concurrent Access: Using WATCH and MULTI to avoid race conditions and ensure data consistency.
12. Advanced Data Structures
Geospatial Indexing: GEO commands allow storing and querying geographic coordinates, supporting radius queries for location-based applications.
Time Series Data: Using sorted sets or modules like RedisTimeSeries for time series data.
13. Backup and Restore
RDB and AOF Backups: Automating backups for disaster recovery.
Snapshot Management: Managing snapshot frequency and retention policies.
Redis Dump and Restore Tools: Tools for data migration or copying across environments.
14. Stream Processing
Redis Streams: Data structure for handling event streams with persistence.
Consumer Groups: Enables multiple consumers to read from the same stream, each getting unique messages.
15. Use Cases and Patterns
Session Store: Storing user sessions in Redis for scalability.
Leaderboards: Using sorted sets for ranking and leaderboards.
Rate Limiting: Controlling request rate, often used in API gateways and throttling.
Distributed Locks: Implementing distributed locks with Redis (e.g., using the Redlock algorithm).
