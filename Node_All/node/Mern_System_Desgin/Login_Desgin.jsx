1. User Role Management .........::::::::::::

Functionality: Assign different roles to users (e.g., admin, user, guest). Based on the role, restrict access to certain pages or functionalities.
Usage: An admin might have access to a dashboard, while a regular
 user may only view general content.

2. Remember Me Feature
Functionality: Implement a "Remember Me" option that keeps users logged in even after closing the browser.
Usage: Store the token in cookies or local storage and use it for
 persistent sessions.


3. Forgot Password
Functionality: Allow users to reset their password via email if they
 forget it. This typically involves generating a unique token and
  sending it to the user's email.

Usage: Users click "Forgot Password," enter their email, and receive a reset link to create a new password.


4. Login Rate Limiting
Functionality: Protect the login endpoint from brute force attacks by limiting the number of login
 attempts within a certain time frame.

Usage: Implement rate-limiting middleware that blocks the IP after several failed attempts in a short period.


5. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
Functionality: Add an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of authentication, 
such as an OTP (One Time Password) sent via email or SMS.

Usage: After entering the password, users must provide an OTP to complete the login process.


6. Social Media Login Integration
Functionality: Allow users to sign in using social media accounts like Google, Facebook, 
or GitHub, using OAuth protocols.

Usage: Users can click on a "Login with Google" button and authenticate through their Google account.


7. Account Locking After Failed Attempts
Functionality: Lock the user account after a certain number of failed login attempts to prevent further attempts.
Usage: Notify users via email when their account gets locked and provide a way to unlock it.


8. Session Timeout
Functionality: Automatically log users out after a period of inactivity for better security.
Usage: Set a timer for inactivity, and log the user out when that timer expires.


9. Login Logs and Notifications
Functionality: Keep track of login attempts, and notify users when a login occurs from a new device or location.
Usage: Send an email notification to users whenever a login occurs from an unrecognized device.

10. Captcha Integration
Functionality: Add a captcha (e.g., Google reCAPTCHA) to prevent bots from attempting automated logins.
Usage: Users must solve the captcha before proceeding with the login.



Example Scenarios:
If email is invalid: The user will see a 400 Bad Request: Invalid email format error.
If password is too short: The user will see a 400 Bad Request: Password too short error.
If email already exists: A 422 Unprocessable Entity error will be returned.
For unexpected issues: A 500 Internal Server Error message will be shown.
